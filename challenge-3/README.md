1. at line 5, `FormattedWalletBalance` can extend `WalletBalance` then add `formatted` property instead of create new interface for repeated properties.
2. at line 11, we can use `BoxProps` directly instead of declaring another interface `Props` then extends `BoxProps`
3. at line 14, the `WalletPage` has already typed as `React.FC<Props>` and it also include the type for the `props` so the `props: Props` is unnecessary.
4. at line 15, the `props` destructuring can be done directly in the line above instead, it also does not reused any where else, the `children` property is not clear to be included in `BoxProps` or not.
5. at line 19, `blockchain` property should not be any, use `string` instead, also, instead of using switch-case, we can declare a list outside of React component, for better readability and reduce the cost of executing function call for better performance.
6. from line 31, `balances` returned from the `useWalletBalances` should be typed before so it does not need to be re-assert type `WalletBalance` for iteration every usage.
7. at line 38, property `blockchain` has not been defined in the `WalletBalance` type, but the code expects it.
8. at line 39, in `balances.filter(...)`, `lhsPriority` is undefined. It should be balancePriority instead, both `lhsPriority > -99` and `balance.amount <= 0` put in the same if block instead.
9. at line 45, the `sort` code block has not solve the case when priority between item is equal, nothing is returned.
10. at line 54, `useMemo` dependencies include `prices`, but sortedBalances does not use prices, causing useless recalculations.
11. at line 56, `formattedBalances` is declared but unused and unnecessary. 
12. at line 63, rows definition re-computes `usdValue` and formatting inline instead of precomputing with a memoized or mapped list.
13. at line 68, map item `index` should not be used as React list key in this case because the order can be changed frequency.
14. at line 71, `balance.formatted` is undefined because the previous redundant `sortedBalances.map` return a new array instead of manipulating source array.
